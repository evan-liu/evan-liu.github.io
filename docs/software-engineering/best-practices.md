title: ðŸ’­ Best Practices
---

When I first started programming, I was eager to learn and apply all the "Best Practices".
Who doesn't want to start standing on the shoulders of giants?

> A best practice is a method or technique that has been generally accepted as superior to alternatives because it tends to produce superior results.

I am now still eager to learn the current "Best Practices" when start something new,
or revisit something built in the past. However, I've learnt over time that:

- They are to solve a problem under certain context/circumstances
- They are considered superior to alternatives at a past point in time

So before or after applying any "Best Practice", I stop and ask some questions:

- What problems(s) do they solve?
  - Do I have the same problem?
  - Do I have the same context/constrains?
- What tradeoff did they make?
- Are there new alternatives now?
- Can I come up with a better alternative?

The software engineering world is rapidly evolving.
[Yesterday's best practice becomes tomorrow's anti-pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGtK5Ga_9sg).
So I'd firstly like to understand the "WHY" and if it still applies,
instead of thinking "that's how things are done around here",
like the monkeys in the [5 Monkeys Experiment](https://i.sstatic.net/MyQki.jpg).

Then, I would like to evaluate my own trade-offs based on the current context
as well as my team's preferences, and determine if the value is worth the effort.

Last but not the least, can I contribute some new ideas myself?

When I first learned [TDD](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html),
I really loved the fast feedback loop.
However, I found it very hard with UI development.
At the time, I was developing games with Flash ActionScript,
and I created [a tool to develop "UI-Unit" in isolation](https://github.com/evan-liu/xface).
It is very similar to the ideas behind [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/),
which is now very popular in web UI development.

When I was migrating an AngularJs project to Angular,
I wasn't happy with the "best practices" on custom icons via icon fonts,
or redux-style state management solutions.
So I created my own SVG based icon components,
and a key-based query layer for fetching/caching/updating server states.
Which are now both common practice in React projects (most icon libraries,
and [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query)).

I will continue learning and building,
try to keep up with the best practices along the way.
Hopefully, make some contribution to the innovations.
