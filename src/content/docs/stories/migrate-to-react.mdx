title: üë®‚Äçüíª Migrate to React

import Link from '@components/Link.astro'

export const components = { a: Link }

I joined a team building a SaaS web app in [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)
in 2017 and started migrating to Angular soon after. I took the
"[Strangler Fig](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html)"
approach, migrating the web app page by page. It wasn't easy, as both AngularJS
and Angular are heavy frameworks, and the bridging channel was not
straightforward to use.

The migration was a success in the end. The new Angular codebase served us well
for years until the UI needed modernization, and we decided to migrate to React
at the same time for the unbeatable React ecosystem.

## React Islands

We decided to use the "[Strangler Fig](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html)"
approach again, and this time, migrating from Angular to React is surprisingly
more straightforward than from AngularJS to Angular. React positions itself as a
view library to render any part of the UI. So I took inspiration from
[Astro Islands](https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/islands/),
putting "React Islands" into the Angular web app for any parts of the UI
starting modernization, just like "vines that germinate in a nook of a tree".

```ts
@Directive({ selector: '[reactIsland]' })
export class ReactIslandDirective<Comp extends ElementType> {
  // The React component to render
  reactComponent = input.required<Comp>({ alias: 'reactIsland' })
  // Props passing to the React component
  props = input<ComponentProps<Comp>>()

  // The root to render the React component
  private root = createRoot(inject(ElementRef).nativeElement)
  // The Angular Injector for integrating with the host Angular app
  private injector = inject(Injector)

  // Rerender the React component when props change
  ngOnChanges() {
    this.root.render(
      createElement(this.reactComponent(), {
        injector: this.injector,
        ...this.props(),
      }),
    )
  }
  ngOnDestroy() {
    this.root.unmount()
  }
}

// Usage:
// <div [reactIsland]="ReactComp" [props]="compProps"></div>
```

## Feature Flags

To avoid interrupting users while still gaining early feedback on the UI
modernization, we hide our "React Islands" under feature flags, only giving
access to a small number of users and allowing them to opt out.

So we need to use feature flags to solve three problems at the same time:

1. Rolling out the "opt-in" option to users.
2. Allowing users to toggle the new UI on and off.
3. Hiding the work-in-progress changes as usual.

We use a "master flag" for both 1 and 2:

- Add the user to the flag to grant them the UI version toggle.
- Update the flag value when users toggle the new UI on and off.

Then create other flags for each work-in-progress UI iteration.

## Drawing Nutrients

A Strangler Fig lives on the host tree. "React Islands" need to "draw nutrients"
from the Angular app for user interactions. The Angular component hosting the
"React Islands" can pass callbacks as props to handle user integration. To avoid
"props drilling," the root of "React Islands" can also provide a React context
for the child components to get the Angular Injector via a `useInjector()` hook
to access any service from the Angular side.

One example is data sync. When a piece of data is re-fetched with an update or
mutated from either side of the system, the other part of the app rendering the
same value needs to be synced.

I built a solution in Angular that works like `Redux + ReactQuery`, which caches
data using keys like [`ReactQuery`](https://tanstack.com/query), with a central
store and dispatches changes like [`Redux`](https://redux.js.org/), using a
simplified "Entity"-based API. Until we completely phase out the old UI, we will
keep using the same data layer in both systems.

This creates "code that will go away once the modernization is complete," but
as [Martin Fowler said](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html):

> While this may appear to be a waste, the reduced risk and earlier value from the
> gradual approach outweigh its costs

## Growing Roots

For the UI modernization, we may only need to "grow the canopy." However, to
eventually migrate off Angular to React, we also need to "grow the roots". We
will rewrite the `useInjector()`-based code in "React ways". We may start
replacing whole pages once the "Strangler Fig" on the page fully grows its roots,
and eventually the "Angular tree" will die.

It is not done yet, but it is going well.
