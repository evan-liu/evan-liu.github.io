[Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/) label each button, link, etc. with letters,
and click it when you type the label.
It is like [Vimium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb)
extension for Google Chrome, at the system level.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import DownloadCard from '@components/DownloadCard.astro'

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Download">
    <DownloadCard url="https://www.homerow.app/" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

[Homerow is not on Homebrew yet](https://github.com/nchudleigh/homerow/issues/29)

üë®‚Äçüíª I used to use [Vimium](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb) on [Arc](https://arc.net/) and Google Chrome,
also [Vimari](https://apps.apple.com/app/vimari/id1480933944) on Safari.
With [Homerow](https://www.homerow.app/) I can do even more with keyboard without reaching to mouse.

However, do not run it on UIs with too many interactive elements.
It freezes the app and I had to "Force Quit" WebStorm before I remembered not to
run Homerow when "Git Log" view is open.
