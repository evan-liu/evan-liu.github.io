![hidden-bar](./hidden-bar.webp)

üë®‚Äçüíª I try to keep every UI minimal, with only information that I need, including OS UI like the menu bar.

Besides System Time and Control Center, I hide all menu items except for:

- Input source. I still need to use [Chinese input](./squirrel) sometime.
- [RAM usage](./stats) until I get a Mac with so big RAM that I no longer care.
- [Battery](./stats) as I often use the Mac off the charger, e.g. in the office.
