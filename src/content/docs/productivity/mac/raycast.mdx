[Raycast](https://www.raycast.com/) has rich built-in features,
an [Extension Store](https://www.raycast.com/store), and it is straightforward
to add own [scripts](https://manual.raycast.com/script-commands)
and [extensions](https://developers.raycast.com/basics/create-your-first-extension#create-a-new-extension).
