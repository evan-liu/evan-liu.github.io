import { LatestRefExample } from '@components/react/latest-ref-example.tsx'

I wasn't a fan of React until it introduced hooks, especially `useEffect()`, which makes lifecycle management much cleaner compared to all other client-side platforms I've worked with, as the initialization code and its cleanup code are colocated.

<div className="flex *:flex-1 gap-4 not-content">

```ts title="Lifecycle methods"
onInit() {
  init_block_1
  init_block_2
  init_block_3
  ...
}

onDestroy() {
  cleanup_block_1
  cleanup_block_2
  cleanup_block_3
  ...
}
```

```ts title="useEffect()"
useEffect(() => {
  init_block_1
  return cleanup_block_1
}, [])
useEffect(() => {
  init_block_2
  return cleanup_block_2
}, [])
useEffect(() => {
  init_block_3
  return cleanup_block_3
}, [])
...
```

</div>

## The Problem

However, the API's cleanliness comes with a cost. The dependency array is confusing and error-prone. If something is missed, the effect may not get triggered when it should, or it may use stale values in the effect closure.

The React team turned to linters and created the "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps" ESLint rule, which brings its own problem of triggering effects more than necessary. I wish the `useEffect()` API was designed with separate parameters for:

- Triggering the effect (the dependency array)
- Updating the values used inside the effect (another parameter)

## The Solution

So I started to use the dependency array only to trigger the effect and used the `useRef()` hook to get the latest value inside the effect.

I learned from [Epic React by Kent C. Dodds](https://www.epicreact.dev/) that this is called the [Latest Ref](https://github.com/epicweb-dev/advanced-react-patterns/tree/main/exercises/02.latest-ref#latest-ref) pattern.

And I implemented the API I wished for:

```ts title="useLatestRefEffect()"
import { type DependencyList, useEffect, useRef } from 'react'

export function useLatestRefEffect<const T extends { [key: string]: any }>(
  effect: (latest: T) => ReturnType<typeof useEffect>,
  deps: DependencyList,
  latest: T,
) {
  let latestRef = useRef(latest)
  let proxyRef = useRef<T>()
  useEffect(() => {
    latestRef.current = latest
  })
  useEffect(() => {
    if (!proxyRef.current) {
      proxyRef.current = new Proxy(latestRef, {
        get: (target, p) => target.current[p as keyof T],
      }) as unknown as T
    }
    return effect(proxyRef.current)
  }, deps)
}
```

```ts title="Usage"
useLatestRefEffect(
  (latest) => {
    // latest.value is always up to date
  },
  [dep], // Triggers the effect
  { value }, // Only update value
)
```

## Example

Here is a simple example, which validates the user's input asynchronously, with a mock check that returns `true` if the length of the value is an odd number, in a random duration between 200ms and 1s.

<LatestRefExample client:load />

It only triggers the async validation when the input value changes, so we only want `value` in the dependency array.

Once the result comes back, we want to use the latest values in the callback.

There are other ways to achieve this and some may be simpler. Below is just to showcase the usage of `useLatestRefEffect()`, which separates the concerns to re-trigger the effect, and keep the values used inside the effect up to date.

```tsx
export function LatestRefExample() {
  let [value, setValue] = useState('')
  let [result, setResult] = useState<boolean | null>(null)
  useLatestRefEffect(
    (latest) => {
      setResult(null)
      check(value).then(
        (valid) => latest.value == value && latest.setResult(valid),
      )
    },
    [value],
    { value, setResult },
  )
  return (
    <div>
      <label>
        Value:
        <input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <span>{result == null ? 'Checking...' : `Result: ${result}`}</span>
    </div>
  )
}

async function check(handle: string) {
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 200 + Math.random() * 800))
  return handle.length % 2 == 1
}
```
