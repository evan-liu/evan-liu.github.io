## Frameworks and Practices

[The Agile Subway Map](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/subway-map-to-agile-practices/)
from Agile Alliance is an excellent representation of major Agile frameworks
and practices.

[Extreme Programming (XP)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/)
focuses on practices and was the dominant Agile method in the late '90s and
early '00s.

[Scrum](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/) focuses on managing the
flow of work and became dominant in the mid-'00s.

(AKA "XP without the technical practices that make it work")

(AKA ‚ÄúScrum That Actually Works‚Äù)
