## Frameworks and Practices

[The Agile Subway Map](https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/subway-map-to-agile-practices/)
from Agile Alliance is an excellent representation of major Agile frameworks
and practices.

[Extreme Programming (XP)](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/xp/)
focuses on practices and was the dominant Agile method in the late '90s and
early '00s.

[Scrum](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/) focuses on managing the
flow of work and became dominant in the mid-'00s.

## Adoption

Agile rapidly gained popularity within just a few years,
which brought some problems.
Several authors of the Agile Manifesto wrote about their concerns and suggestions:

- Martin Fowler: [Agile Imposition](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/AgileImposition.html) (2006)
- Martin Fowler: [Flaccid Scrum](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html) (2009)
- Dave Thomas: [Agile is Dead (Long Live Agility)](https://pragdave.me/thoughts/active/2014-03-04-time-to-kill-agile.html) (2014)
- Ron Jeffries: [Developers Should Abandon Agile](https://ronjeffries.com/articles/018-01ff/abandon-1/) (2018)

### Problems

The common problems are:

- Instead of the values and principles, only project management processes are applied.
- These project management processes (normally Scrum) are imposed on the team.

Which contradict the first value of Agile:

<div>
  <AgileValue side="left" />
  <span class="mx-2 text-sm font-light">over</span>
  <AgileValue side="right" />
</div>

And some of the principles:

- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.

Another Agile Manifesto author, Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob),
also talked about this in
[a recent interview](https://youtu.be/UBXXw2JSloo?si=WWCBqeSeb4IRC8zx&t=1604) (2024):

The project managers flooded into Agile for "Certified ScrumMaster",
took over "Agile" and pushed programmers out.
"Agile" became a project management idea.

### Suggestions

The articles from the Agile Manifesto authors made similar suggestions:

Firstly, "back to the values and principles".
Agile is [People Oriented](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/PeopleOriented.html),
teams should be "self-organizing", choose their own process and control how
that process evolves.

Secondly, apply strong technical practices.
The XP practices make a good starting point.

> "Scrum is just XP without the technical practices that make it work."

> (XP is) "The Scrum That Actually Works".

## 💭 My thoughts

The problem Agile try to solve:

Instead of failing in the end of a long painful waterfall process,
how can a team keep delivering real value and respond to changes?

The answer is "early and continuous delivery" of "Working software",
with "Customer collaboration" and "Responding to change".

For that we need "agility", via "Individuals and interactions" of an empowered,
self-organizing team, and strong technical practices.

> Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.

However, after the project managers took over "Agile" via Scrum,
engineering practices were omitted.

DevOps movement seems to me like the software engineers then splintered from
"Agile" and expanded some of the XP practices (e.g.
["Continuous integration"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Continuous_integration)
and ["Small releases"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Small_releases)).

With modern DevOps and [Continuous Delivery](https://continuousdelivery.com/),
iterations can be so small that some Agile practices, like the XP
[Planning Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming_practices#Planning_game),
may no longer be needed.
