<AgileTimelineItem time="1970s" title="Wideband Delphi">
  Barry Boehm proposes “Wideband Delphi”, a forerunner of **Planning Poker**.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1976" title="Automated Unit Testing">
  [A series of articles](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/800253.807721) by D.
  Panzl describing tools with features closely resembling those of JUnit attest
  to the long history of automated unit testing.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1977" title="Automating Software Builds">
  Creation of the “make” tool for Unix systems – the principle of automating
  software builds is not a new idea.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1980" title="Visual Control">
  The notion of “visual control” originating in the Toyota Production System is
  an anticipation of **“information radiators”**.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1984" title="Knowledge-based communication processes">
  While criticisms of the **“waterfall”** sequential approach have started much
  earlier, formulations of alternative incremental approaches are becoming more
  pointed; a good example is an early paper on [”Knowledge-based communication
  processes in software
  engineering”](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/800054.801993) advocating
  incremental development for the specific reason that “complete and stable
  specifications are not available”.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1985" title="Evolutionary Delivery Model">
  Perhaps the first explicitly named, incremental alternative to the
  **“waterfall”** approach is Tom Gilb’s [Evolutionary Delivery
  Model](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1012483.1012490), nicknamed “Evo”.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1986" title="Scrum Framework Inspiration">
  Takeuchi and Nonaka publish their article [”The New New Product Development
  Game”](https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game) in
  Harvard Business Review. The article describes a rugby approach where “the
  product development process emerges from the constant interaction of a
  hand-picked, multidisciplinary team whose members work together from start to
  finish.” This article is often cited as the inspiration for the **Scrum**
  framework.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1988" title="Rapid Iterative Production Prototyping">
  The **“timebox”** is described as a cornerstone of Scott Schultz’s “Rapid
  Iterative Production Prototyping” approach in use at a Du Pont spin-off,
  Information Engineering Associates.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1990" title="Refactoring">
  Bill Opdyke coins the term “refactoring” in an ACM SIGPLAN paper with Ralph
  Johnson, “Refactoring: An aid in designing application frameworks and evolving
  object-oriented systems”
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1991" title="Rapid Application Development">
  RAD, possibly the first approach in which **timeboxing** and **“iterations”**
  in the looser sense of “one repetition of the entire software development
  process” are closely combined, is described by James Martin in his [”Rapid
  Application Development”](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0023767758). This book
  also describes the details of the timebox in one of its chapters.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1992" title="Dynamic Duo Coding">
  “Dynamic Duo” is the term coined by Larry Constantine, reporting on a visit to
  Whitesmiths Inc., a compiler vendor started by P.J. Plauger, one of the
  implementors of C: “At each terminal were two programmers! Of course, only one
  programmer was actually cutting code at each keyboard, but the others were
  peering over their shoulders.” Whitesmiths existed from 1978 to 1988.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem
  time="1993"
  title="The Benefits Of Collaboration For Student Programmers">
  “The benefits of collaboration for student programmers” by Wilson et al. is
  one early empirical study indicating benefits of pairing for programming tasks
  specifically. Posterior studies are more abundant and driven by the desire to
  “validate” **pair programming** after it had already gained popularity through
  Extreme Programming.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1993" title="Stand-Up Meeting Pattern">
  Jim Coplien writes the original **Stand-Up Meeting** pattern.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1993" title="Continuous Integration">
  The phrase **“continuous integration”** is already in use and thus predates
  what will later be known as Agile processes, for instance an article written
  this year contrasts it with “scheduled” integration, and recommends the
  latter, citing “lack of thorough testing” as one issue with continuous
  integration; this helps explain why the automated testing favored by Agile
  teams is an enabler for continuous integration.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1993" title="Invention Of Scrum">
  Jeff Sutherland invents Scrum as a process at Easel Corporation.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem
  time="1995"
  title="Growth Of Human Factors In Application Development">
  An article by Alistair Cockburn, ”Growth of human factors in application
  development”, suggests one major reason why iterative approaches gradually
  gain acceptance: the bottleneck in software development is shifting to
  (individual and organizational) learning, and human learning is intrinsically
  an iterative, trial and error process.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1995" title="Sprint As Iteration">
  The earliest writings on Scrum introduce the notion of the “sprint” as
  iteration, although its duration is variable.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1995" title="Formal Introduction Of Scrum">
  Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland co-present Scrum at the OOPSLA Conference.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1996" title="Daily Build And Smoke Test">
  Steve McConnell describes the [“Daily Build and Smoke
  Test”](https://stevemcconnell.com/articles/daily-build-and-smoke-test/)
  technique, used at Microsoft for Windows NT 3.0 during the 1990’s; the
  emphasis is not so much on the automation as on the frequency, the daily cycle
  being at that time considered “extreme”.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1996" title="Acceptance Testing">
  Automated tests are a practice of Extreme Programming, without much emphasis
  on the distinction between unit and acceptance testing, and with no particular
  notation or tool recommended.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1997" title="Daily Scrum">
  Ken Schwaber describes the **“daily scrum”** (which does not appear in his
  earlier writings, such as the 1995 article “SCRUM Development Process”), this
  is later recast in pattern form [by Mike
  Beedle](http://www.jeffsutherland.org/objwld98/scrum_pattern.html).
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1998" title="Extreme Programming">
  The earliest article about Extreme Programming, “Chrysler goes to Extremes”,
  describes several XP practices such as self-chosen tasks, test first, three
  week iterations, collective code ownership, and pair programming.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1999" title="System Metaphor">
  Early on in the elaboration of Extreme Programming, the “System Metaphor”
  practice is proposed to address the issues of business-technical translation
  and cognitive friction, however the practice is poorly understood and fails to
  catch on.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1999" title="Iterative And Incremental">
  In an article for the C++ Report, Robert C. Martin gives what is perhaps the
  earliest description of the Agile sense of the terms **“iterative”** and
  **“incremental”**.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="1999" title="Refactoring Popularized">
  The practice of **“refactoring”**, incorporated a few years earlier into
  Extreme Programming, is popularized by [Martin Fowler’s
  book](https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Improving-Design-Existing-Code/dp/0201485672/)
  of the same name.
</AgileTimelineItem>

<AgileTimelineItem time="2001" title="Agile Manifesto authored">
  Bob Martin called a "Lightweight Process Summit" to create a manifesto that
  outlined similarities between all the various lightweight processes. The 17
  attendees decided to use the term **"agile"** and wrote the "Manifesto for
  Agile Software Development". Some of the authors wrote up their recollections
  of writing the Agile Manifesto: [Bob
  Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/the-founding-of-the-agile-alliance),
  [Martin Fowler](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agileStory.html), [Dave
  Thomas](https://pragdave.me/thoughts/active/2007-02-24-some-agile-history.html),
  [Jim Highsmith](https://agilemanifesto.org/history.html).
